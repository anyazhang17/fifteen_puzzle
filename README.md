# fifteen_puzzle
The tiles are arranged in the 4 x 4 layout made of 4 rows and 4 columns. 
Since there are 16 spaces (positions) and only 15 tiles, one space is empty. 
There is a GUI window with the game layout that is controllable by the mouse button clicks. 
The user can play the game (or solve the puzzle) by selecting an adjacent tile to the empty space 
and moving it to the empty space position: up, down, left, or right depending on the tile location. 
The solution to the Fifteen puzzle is positioning of all numebred tiles in numerical order, increasing 
from left to right and top to the bottom. The empty tile should be at the bottom right space.
